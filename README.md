This HTML code creates a dynamic blog called "Nature's Therapy." It features a responsive design and includes sections for:
Home: Displays the latest blog posts.
Posts: Shows all blog posts.
Post View: Renders a single blog post with its content and comments.
New Post: Allows users to create and publish new blog posts.
Login & Register: Provides user authentication functionality.
The JavaScript handles the dynamic display of sections, post rendering (including markdown-like formatting for bold text and lists), and basic user management (registration and login). It also supports adding comments to posts, with comments attributed to logged-in users or "Anonymous."
